## Motivation

Often times I will keep all of my files in the download folder for my PC. Whether it is videos, music, documents, or applications the files will stay in my downloads folder until one day I decide to delete the files. For this project I wanted to create an application that will sort files in a downloads folder by file extension and move the files to the correct corresponding folder. 

## Demonstration





## Languages

The language used for this project was Python. The libraries that were used were OS, Shutil, and pathlib

## Usage

A download package will be coming soon for user to download and run on their own computer.
